This app is an eCommerce site that features a variety of taxidermy items. 

Using React, Redux, and Firebase (both for database storage and deployment), this app allows users to sign up using an email/password combination, or by signing in with Google authentication.

Users can view items across 5 different categories, add/remove items to their cart, increase/decrease the quantity of items ordered, and even check out using a stripe payment (demo) method. 

At this point in time, this app is still in development as there are some hurdles that have been very difficult to get over (ex: local images not displaying, and firebase deployment not updating with cart components), but Stay Tuned! This will be a beautiful site once I get past the few things that are stalling me right now!
